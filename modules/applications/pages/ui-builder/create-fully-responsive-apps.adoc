= Create Fully Responsive Applications
:description: Enhance the layout to ensure the application is fully responsive.

{description}

Although applications built with UI Builder are responsive by default, certain settings should be avoided to ensure full responsiveness.

== Fixed Height

Setting a fixed height for a widget may cause display issues on different window sizes.

For example, if you set the `Height` property to `Fixed` for a Container widget, the content may become truncated when the window is resized.

== Scroll Content

For some widgets, for example the Container widget, you can use the `Scroll content` property if you want to maintain a fixed size.

== Example

1. Drop a Container widget on the page:
- Set the `Height` property to `Fixed`
- Disable the `Scroll contents` property

2. Drop a Text widget inside the Container:
- Expand it to the width of the Container
- Add some text to fill the Text widget

Preview the page and resize the window: you will see that the content is truncated when the window is small:

Now, set the `Height` property of the Container to `Auto Height` and preview the page again:
you will see that the content is displayed correctly, the Container height adapts to the content:
