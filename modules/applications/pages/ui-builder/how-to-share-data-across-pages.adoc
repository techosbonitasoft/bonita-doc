== Send data using query parameters

Let’s say you want to send parameters to another page using what was typed in a text widget.

To do so, drag and drop a text widget and a button widget. The button widget should be configured like this:

image:ui-builder/guides/configure-query-params.png[configure-query-params]


The `navigate to` function will redirect to the chosen page. The query params will be passed between the source and the target page's URL: `your-application/target-page/edit?xx=value`


== Store data using Store functions

The `storeValue()` function stores the data in the browser’s local storage as key-value pairs that represent storage objects and can be later accessed anywhere in the application.

If you want to store the text of an input widget, you can use `storeValue()` as shown below:
[source, JS]
----
{{storeValue('email',input1.text)}}
----

Here, `email` is the key where the value is stored, and `input1.text` is the value in the input widget that's saved in the storage object.

Once done, retrieve stored data using `{{appsmith.store.email}}` in your queries and other widgets.

Instead of writing code, you can also store data from the widget's settings, see our xref:how-to-control-visibility-of-widgets.adoc#_using_the_storevalue_function[other guide] for more details.

Please note that you can use the `clearStore()` function which clears all the data that was stored in the local storage of the browser, as well as the `removeValue()` function which clears the value associated with a specified key.
